The physical principles in compensated polarized light microscopy (CPLM) are not well-understood by clinicians using the modality to analyze synovial fluid. 
We have created a mathematical model to describe the physics behind CPLM, which can simulate different situations for different types of crystals.
The model is available in both MATLAB as Python. For the MATLAB code, please download the CPLM_simulation.m, rod.m and MCross.m files, together with the .csv for 
the LED simulation. You can adapt the CPLM_simulation.m file to either simulate rods and Maltese cross birefringent objects. The python file is a single file which
also needs the .csv for the LED simulation.
